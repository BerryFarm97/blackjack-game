# Blackjack Game (Python CLI)

A simple command-line Blackjack game built in Python. This project was created as a way to practice and demonstrate core programming skills including control flow, functions, loops, list management, and game logic. The player competes against a computer-controlled dealer following standard Blackjack rules.

## Features

- Fully shuffled 52-card deck
- Realistic card dealing and score calculation
- Player can hit or stand
- Dealer draws until reaching at least 17
- Automatic win/loss/tie detection
- Clean, readable CLI output
- Modular, professional code structure

## How to Play

1. Run the game:
2. You will be dealt two cards.
3. The dealer shows one card face up.
4. You can choose to hit (draw a card) or stand (end your turn).
5. If your score goes over 21, you bust and lose.
6. Once you stand, the dealer plays their turn.
7. Final scores are compared to determine the winner.

## Tech Used

- Python 3
- Standard library only (`random`, `time`)

## Files

- `blackjack.py` – Main game logic
- `README.md` – This file

## Future Ideas

- Add betting system and player balance
- Replay loop after each round
- High score or win tracking
- GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt
